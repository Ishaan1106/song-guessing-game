# Intro what is happening in the game
so, in this project there is basically a game made suing python. 
simply if you run the file, it will ask you `are you ready?`
and you have to select `YES, NO` (by typing them) both are same if you select NO then it will still continue.  
then it will ask which language? 
there's catch to like, if you have chosen `English` then it will show you English song lyrics but in Hindi (written in English)
and if you have chosen `Hindi` then it will show the Hindi songs with English 
there lyrics will randomly come on screen
if you guess correct it will show  `hurray!` at the end 
but if the song guess is wrong then it will show "try again"
